In June 2016, an early group of builders, archivists, policymakers, and journalists gathered for the first <a href="https://2016.decentralizedweb.net/">Decentralized Web Summit</a> within the columns of the Internet Archive headquarters in San Francisco, home to <a href="https://archive.org/">one of the world’s largest digital libraries</a>. Its founder, Brewster Kahle, issued <a href="http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/">a challenge</a> to these early developers: let&#39;s use decentralized technologies to &ldquo;Lock the Web Open,&rdquo; this time for good.
        </p>
        <p>
2016&#39;s gathering was a call to the Dreamers to build a better Web.

2018&#39;s <b>Decentralized Web Summit – Global Visions / Working Code</b> is a demonstration of how far we have come. With scores of prototypes and apps now built with decentralized protocols, it&#39;s time to collaborate, communicate and engage the communities who need these tools the most.
